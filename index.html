      <p>How like a winter hath my absence been</p>
      <p>From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!</p>
      <p>What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!</p>
      <p>What old December's bareness everywhere!</p>
      <p>And yet this time removed was summer's time;</p>
      <p>The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,</p>
      <p>Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,</p>
      <p>Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:<p>
      <p>Yet this abundant issue seemed to me</p>
      <p>But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit;</p>
      <p>For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,</p>
      <p>And, thou away, the very birds are mute:</p>
      <p>Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,</p>
      <p>That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.</p>
